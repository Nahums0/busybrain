## Description of the Core Algorithm and Scheduling Philosophies:

Busybrain's scheduling mechanism operates on a unique combination of the Eisenhower Matrix and time-blocking, merged with machine learning elements for personalization.

At its essence, the algorithm first classifies tasks based on urgency and importance. It creates four categories, akin to the Eisenhower Matrix:

Urgent and important.
Not urgent but important.
Urgent but not important.
Neither.
Post categorization, tasks are then matched to the user's available time slots. The time-blocking method aids in this, reserving specific blocks of time for specific task types.

What makes Busybrain stand apart is its adaptive nature. Over time, as users might reschedule, skip, or prioritize certain tasks over others, the system takes note. Through subtle machine learning techniques, it refines its categorization and scheduling suggestions, morphing itself more and more into the user's natural rhythm and preference.

The resultant algorithm is not just reactive, like most schedulers, but proactive, making Busybrain not just a tool but a productivity partner.
